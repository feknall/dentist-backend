# dentist-backend
Description: Imagine you want to communicate with your dentist to ask your questsions or tell her about your toothache. Do you like to share some pictures about your pain with the dentist? Don't Worry! Also, the dentist wants to share some of his tips about taking care of tooths to his patients. Maybe she wants to send a simple text or a video file to all of his patients. It's fine! Addtionally, the dentist can schedule some notifictions to be send to his patients automatically. This code is backend of a project that does all those things. 

Please consider that this is not a super clean code or a code that I like to show others. Actually, this is a project that I would never to work on it again untill doing some serious refactoring. However, it works!
